    <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
            carnivorous
            mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and
            genetics
            have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept
            as a
            house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans
            for
            companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like
            mice
            and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of
            smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.Female
            domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in
            equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and
            shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats
            may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted
            in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile
            species.

            As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats
            owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a
            cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated
            220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.
            Evolution

            The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10 to 15 million
            years ago.[25] The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to
            14.45 million years ago.[26] Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at
            6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.[27] The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7
            million years ago.[26] Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved
            through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial
            selection.[28] The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38
            chromosomes[29] and roughly 20,000 genes.[30]
